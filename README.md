# Ghoti Translator

Ghoti Translator is a simple Blazor WebAssembly application that takes user input and transforms it into an idiosyncratic spelling based on phonetic rules, similar to how "ghoti" can represent "fish".

## Core Features (WIP)

- Enter any text into a textarea
- The app converts the input to an alternative spelling

## TODO/Future Improvements

- Improve phonetic transformation rules for better accuracy
- Allow users to add to/select different phonetic mapping styles

# Tech Stuff

- Built with Blazor WebAssembly for fast, client-side rendering (and an excuse to learn C#/Blazor/WASM)
- Deployed as a static site via GitHub Pages
